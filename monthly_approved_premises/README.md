# Monthly approved premises

Directory contains FSA monthly updates of approved food establishments.

The monthly updates of approved food establishments are produced by FSA and are available at: https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/approved-food-establishments#list-of-approved-food-establishments.

Processing of FSA monthly updates of approved food establishments in public domain is allowed by Open Government Licence v3 (see: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Starting in Jan 2018, the naming convention for the monthly update of approved premises took the format ```approved-food-establishments-as-at-1-MONTH-YEAR.csv```. This continued until September 2021. However, thereafter the naming convention became a bit more random with:
1. October 2021 update named ```ApprovedPremisesOct21.csv```
2. November 2021 update named ```APMSNov21.csv```
3. December 2021 update named ```Approved+establishments+01-12-2021.csv```
4. January 2022 update named ```ApprovedPremisesJan22.csv```
