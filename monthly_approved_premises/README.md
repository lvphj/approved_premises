# Monthly approved premises

Directory contains FSA monthly updates of approved food establishments.

The monthly updates of approved food establishments are produced by FSA and are available at: https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/approved-food-establishments#list-of-approved-food-establishments.

Processing of FSA monthly updates of approved food establishments in public domain is allowed by Open Government Licence v3 (see: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Prior to Oct 2024, when files were downloaded, spaces were replaced with either a hyphen or a plus sign. Thereafter, the same file would have spaces in the filename. For example, originally the file for Sept 2023 was downloaded as `Approved+establishments+01-10-2023.csv` but later, the same file would be downloaded as `Approved establishments 01-10-2023.csv`.
