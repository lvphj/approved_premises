# Outputs

The outputs directory contains latest versions of ```phjLatestAbattoir.csv``` and ```phjLatestAppno.csv``` (together with equivalent pickled files). These files are created after running the code in the Jupyter Notebook. The outputs can be used by siu-ssdp22 repository to upload to database.

The directory also contains a file called ```phjLatestAppnoDetails.csv``` which contains just the latest details for each Appno.
