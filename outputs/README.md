# Outputs

The outputs directory contains latest versions of ```phjLatestAbattoir.csv``` and ```phjLatestAppno.csv``` (together with equivalent pickled files). These files are created after running the code in the Jupyter Notebook. The outputs can be used directly to upload to database without the need to run the Python code contained in .ipynb file. This is useful where required Python libraries (e.g. NLP libraries used to identify whether names of premises have changed substantially) cannot be installed.

The directory also contains a file called ```phjLatestAppnoDetails.csv``` which contains just the latest details for each Appno.
